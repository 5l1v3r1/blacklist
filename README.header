## Features
* Generates configuration files used directly by dnsmasq to redirect dns lookups
* Integrated with the EdgeMax OS CLI
* Any FQDN in the blacklist will force dnsmasq to return the configured dns redirect IP address

## Compatibility
* update-dnsmasq.pl has been tested on the EdgeRouter Lite and ER-X family of routers, versions v1.7.0-v1.9.7+hotfix.4
* Since the EdgeOS is a fork and port of Vyatta 6.3, this script could be adapted to work on VyOS and Vyatta derived ports
